   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Klang's documentation!
=================================

Klang is no different than Kaleidoscope introduced in `LLVM Tutorial <http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/>`_. It is just one of Kaleidoscope.
But Klang is being reconstructured to be similar to Clang! Doing this provides fun and a lot of motivation to study LLVM and Clang. As you know Kaleidoscope is implemented in toy.cpp. Klang is another toy!

After some time, I'd like to upgrade Klang. I'd like Klang has more features than Kaleidoscope!
